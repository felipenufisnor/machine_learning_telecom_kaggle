Machine Learning:  K-nearest neighbors, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree Classification 

In this project, I applied machine learning to the Verizon database available on Kaggle;
I explored what classification tasks are;
Classified new customers according to their loyalty;
I understood how the classification models work: K-nearest neighbors, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree;
I compared the results of different algorithms in order to validate the models and solved problems with based on data science.
